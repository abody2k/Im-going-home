A 3D game, for the One Game a Month #41 game jam, you can either clone the source code and run it using godot game engine
or run the game directly on itch.io when the game is released.


The game revolves around an alien life in this case the player that can posses or take control of one of the crew members of a spaceship to finally achieve the goal
of not letting them go back home, however, everytime the alien switch their body they lose enery so it's limited how many times it can be done.
